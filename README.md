* The app is seperated into 2 parts - Admin and User.
* The Admin stories are undone for now. However, all user stories are implemented.
* Dummy data (hardcoded) is used to facilitate the user stories.
* LocalStorage is used for persisting data. To invalidate the persisted data (to begin the user story all over again), please clear the application's LocalStorage from the browsers console's `Application tab`
* The application leverages NG-Zorro UI component library for the navbar and sidebar.
* Sass is used for styling
* RxJS is used for easier transmission of events accross components
* Tests are NOT implemented
